There are a couple issues: here they are::

1. adding  the two scripts (navbar.js) and (buttons.js) on ANY of these does not work; only one works, but not the other, and which one works depends on the order of how they're placed. In lieu of this I've just used one script, but combined the efforts of both scripts. I don't like this solution, but it works.

2. I 'added' a script call in the middle of the body to write the check out page. I know this isn't normal or even a good way to do things, but again it works and it gives me some pretty decent flexibility.

3. I didn't add the checkout to the navBar because I feel: 
	i) it's not somewhere you'd want to navigate without pushing buttons or being explicitly told, as it's kind of a 'nothing' page otherwise.
	ii) there's already an area on each page (on the index, there's 2) to get onto the page, so it seems kind of moot.

4.There is a single absolutely positioned item; that is the cat image itself. relatively positioned items include the name on the navbar,
