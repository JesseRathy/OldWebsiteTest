			<p>I am currently a third year undergraduate student in the Univeristy of Saskatchewan's College of Arts and Science; I am currently working towards a degree with a major in Computer Science, with a possible minor in English as well. With my education, I hope to be able to gain a career in software development or web development primarily, though I also find game development and simulation modelling of moderate interest.</p>

			<h1>Hobbies</h1>

			<p>In my downtime, I play games of all types, though mainly play video games. I also enjoy cooking for friends and family and trying new recipes, though often my family doesn't like my cooking due to how spicy it is. Finally, the hobby I've spent a lot of time on recently is the playing, listening of and discussion of music with close friends. </p>
